## What This Skill Does

Talk About Us applies [Anil Dash's shareability framework](https://www.anildash.com/2025/12/05/talk-about-us-without-us/) to audit your content. It runs four tests:

1. **The Absence Test** - Can someone authentically explain this when you're not there?
2. **The Distinctiveness Test** - Does this say what only YOU can say?
3. **The Emotional Resonance Test** - Is this emotionally gripping or comprehensively technical?
4. **The Values-First Test** - Are values embedded in how people naturally discuss this?

## Usage Examples

**Audit local content:**
```
Use the talk-about-us skill to review our About page copy
```

**Audit a URL:**
```
Use the talk-about-us skill to audit the content on https://example.com
```

**Quick check:**
```
Apply the shareability audit to this paragraph: "We leverage innovative solutions..."
